## Activity-15
This assignment is desiged to help the user become more adept with GitHub. By using the previous assignment we can use it to explore GitHubs many functions. By learning the ins and outs of GitHub it will allow the user to publish their code in a meaningful manner while also showing how they did it through theyre commits and various readme files. Overall, this assignments provides the user with the chance to increase theyre documentation and coding skils.

**Project details/Short Summary** 
  * QMD file was created in Rstudio.
  * Began with creating a two way freq. table using pre-existing data from previous assignment.
  * Labeled the data accordingly and displayed it using various techniques inplemented in quarto.
  * Moved onto next dataset and displayed it. Paired with narrative text beneath it for further clarification.
  * Repeated with Boxplot data.
  * Lastly, added code summary for anyone interested in replication.

**Assignment 14 more in depth details**
For this assignment I created a QMD file based of three previous assignments 
where I had to gather, clean and modify the data to fit a table and graph. Most data was provided in the form of csv files. This code was then used in a well formatted QMD file where I inserted each piece of code and visual for better analysis. I also followed up with a brief description under each visual to enchance the readers knowledge as to what is being displayed.

**Current plan**
The current idea for this repo task is to insert both files associated with assignment 14, those 
being the QMD and PDF. Using the newly created repo any user can fully access this assignment and view the code as well as the fully rendered pdf. Now I have already created the repor as well as added the proper files. Other Chnages that I would consider in the future would be formatting anything that may need fixing.

**Workflow**
 * I have created a dev branch where any modification is made before merging with main.
